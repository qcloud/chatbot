== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin zip file. Extract and upload in your wp-content/plugins folder.
2. From the wp-admin panel go to plugins and activate "Chatbot"
4. You are done.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the ChatBot support OpenAI GPT-3? =
OpenAI GPT3 is now supported with all WPBot pro ChatBot packages. For advanced OpenAI features like fine tuning and training OpenAI Pro module is required (available with WPBot pro Professional and Master licenses).

= Getting Started with OpenAI =
Once you add the OpenAI API key, the ChatBot should already start working for generic questions. Open a new browser window in Incognito mode and test by asking "What is the capital of Japan?"

Please make sure DialogFlow is Disabled if you want OpenAI to work with the ChatBot

= OpenAI not working. ChatBot Keeps loading =
If OpenAI is not responding back and the chatbot is just loading, then likely you hit your OpenAI usage limit. Add a billing detail and increase the Usage limit.
https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview

= How to get an OpenAI API Key for the ChatBot? =
The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. Visit your API Keys page to retrieve the API key you‚Äôll use in your requests. Remember that your API key is a secret! Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). You can grab the API key for the chatbot from this page: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys

= Can I use both DialogFlow and OpenAI GPT3 with the ChatBot? =
No. They will not both work together. Please disable DialogFlow if you want OpenAI to work for the ChatBot.

= Is my language supported? =
The ChatBot can work with ANY language. Just change the language texts from the ChatBot Settings->Language Center to your preferred one. Multi language is supported with the WpBot Pro version and an addon.

= I am not getting emails from the ChatBot =
The WPBot ChatBot uses the WordPress' default email function. If you are not getting emails from the ChatBot's email feature, it is likely that no emails are getting through from your WordPress site or they are ending up in the Spam box. Try using an SMTP mailer plugin. Also, try changing the to and from email addresses in the ChatBot's general settings area.

= I cannot connect the ChatBot to DialogFlow =
To Debug: 1. Make sure that you have created the Google Project and the Service account as an Owner
2. Make sure that you have connected to the correct Dialogflow agen
3. Follow the steps in this tutorial correctly: https://www.wpbot.pro/dialogflow-integration/
4. Make sure that the Google Client Package is Installed on Your Website.
5. Make sure to download and import the sample DialogFlow agent to your agent
6. Test the ChatBot in the browser Incognito mode

= Simple text responses are not working or getting an error =
WPBot requires mysql version 5.6+ for the simple text responses to work. If your server has a version below that, you might see some PHP error or the Simple Text Responses will not work at all. Please request your hosting support to update the mysql version on your server.

= I cannot save the settings =
It is likely that your server has a very low value for a server settings called Max Input Vars. Please contact your hosting support and request them to increase the max_input_vars value to 5000

= I changed language or some other settings but do not see them when testing =
Please clear the browser cache and <strong>cookies</strong> to see any change you have made. Alternatively, you can open a fresh browser window in incognito mode (Ctrl+Shift+N in chrome) to test your changes. Also, you may need to purge any cache plugin and CDN caching.

= The ChatBot is NOT working in the front end. =
The most common reason for this is if the theme is coded incorrectly and jQuery is loaded from external source. jQuery is included with WordPress core and according to WordPress standard, jQuery must be included using wp_enqueue_script. https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/ . Please make sure if that is the case in your theme. 

Please contact us if you need [further help](https://www.wpbot.pro/free-support/). We take all user feedback sriously.

= The ChatBot is stuck on typing or loading =
This usually happens if you enabled DialogFlow but did not complete the set up. Please make sure that you have carefully followed all the steps for DialogFlow integration in the Settings->DialogFlow section.
[This article](https://www.wpbot.pro/dialogflow-integration/) can also be helpful in getting the required information from DialogFlow console.

This can also happen if there is any empty language fields or Simple Text Responses database needs updating because of mysql version changes. Try saving both the Language Center and Simple Text Responses.


= How do I add new conversations to the ChatBot? =
Without DialogFlow: You can create simple text conversations with the <strong>[Conversational Form Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/conversational-forms/)</strong> addon by using the HTML elements to dislay your responses. The adoon's free version does not support Conditional responses. The pro version does. But you can create linear conversations and display them from the Start menu. Once you have created a form using the Conversational form builder addon you can add it to the ChatBot start menu from the WPBot Settings->Start Menu. Make sure to always Save the ChatBot Start menu settings after rearranging the columns.

You can also create text responses for the ChatBot using the Simple Text Responses feature inside the WordPress dashboard.

With DialogFlow: You can create new Intents and Text responses inside DialogFlow. For each user input, WPBot will automatically connect to DialogFlow and try to match with the Itents and training Data you added. When an Intent is matched, its response will be returned to the user.

= Does the ChatBot work with Google's DialogFlow V2 =
Yes, currently the ChatBot works both with Dialogflow version 1 and 2. V1 support will stop on Oct 23rd, 2019. 

[This article](https://www.wpbot.pro/dialogflow-integration/) can also be helpful in getting the required information from DialogFlow console.

= How do I add Line Breaks? =
Please use the br html tag for line breaks.

= Are HTML tags supported? =
Yes, common HTML tags link link href, strong, br etc. are supported.

= Does the ChatBot support images, GIFs, Videos =
Images, GIFs and Youtube Videos are supprted in the pro version. Pro version also includes a handy giphy floating search for easy embed in the language center.
